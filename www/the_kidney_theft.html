        <p>A businessman is staying at a hotel for a couple of night and decides to have a couple of drinks in the bar before going to bed. In the bar a young woman sits down next to him and they get chatting; she buys him another drink and he remembers nothing more of the evening. The next morning he wakes up in the bathtub, up to his neck in ice, with a tube protruding from a very neat incision in his lower back &#8211; and a note propped up beside the bath that says &#8220;you need urgent medical assistance &#8211; call 911&#8221;. As soon as he describes the situation to the operator she says &#8220;is there a tube sticking out of your lower back?&#8221; and when he says yes, she says &#8220;okay, don&#8217;t move, the ambulance is on its way. I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve become a victim of a criminal ring that steals human organs to sell &#8211; they&#8217;ve taken one of your kidneys.&#8221;</p>
