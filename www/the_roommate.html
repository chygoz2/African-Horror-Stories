        <p>The Roommate is one of the most scary urban myths and legends that had been popularized. According to the legend, late one evening, a young college girl decided to collect her books from her room ready for the next day so she could spend the night at her boyfriend&#8217;s dorm. Knowing her roommate would be sleeping she didn&#8217;t turn on the light, but stumbled around for several minutes as she collected what she needed and left. The next day she came home after classes to find the police outside her room and crime scene tape all around. When she said she lived there, the policeman looked at her a bit strangely and asked if she had been there last night, but without turning on the light? Confused, she said yes, how did you know? The policeman led her into the room; there was no sign of her roommate, but on the wall was a message, written in blood: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you glad you didn&#8217;t turn on the light?&#8221;</p>
