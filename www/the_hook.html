        <p>Two young teenagers are making out in a car when an announcement on the radio says a murderer has escaped from the prison and he is armed and dangerous. The mood broken, the frightened girl insists her boyfriend take her home and he finally agrees but says he has to &#8216;take a leak&#8217; first, and she is to lock the doors after he leaves and only open them when he gets back. After quite a while he hasn&#8217;t returned and it becomes obvious something has happened &#8211; she decides to drive the car to look for him, but the keys are missing. Then she starts hearing scraping noises outside and huddles in the middle of the back seat, terrified until finally it gets light and she decides to make a run for the highway. She gets out and sprints up to the main road, then looks back &#8211; and sees the body of her boyfriend hanging from a tree over the car, swinging slightly in the breeze, his feet just scraping along the roof.</p>
