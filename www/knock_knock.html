        <p>Two youngsters were left alone in the house for a short time late at night while their parents popped out, telling them not to answer the door under any circumstances and that their neighbours knew they were going to be gone for a while so if there were any problems they could go next door. The kids watched TV for a while then went to bed, but a bit later they were jolted awake by a knocking on the door &#8211; knock, knock, knock &#8230; They did as they&#8217;d been told and ignored it, but the knocking came again and finally the sister got up to go down and see who it was. The brother waited a while longer but his sister didn&#8217;t come back and he heard nothing more.</p>
        <p>Becoming uneasy, he decided to go next door and in his pajamas, padded down to the door in the dark and slipped out. The neighbours were still up and greeted him with the news that a murderer had killed someone only a few blocks away earlier in the evening. When they realised the sister was unaccounted for, they told him to stay there while they went back to the house with a gun &#8211; as they got there, they found the sister&#8217;s body on the floor, and a discarded knife on her brother&#8217;s empty bed.</p>
